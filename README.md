# poplus-theme

Poplus is an organization that builds technology to help civic and democratic activists all over the world.

As part of this, it produces components, promoted by github-pages sites like http://mapit.poplus.org, http://popit.poplus.org, and http://writeit.poplus.org.

Those promotional sites use this standard library for most of their styles.
